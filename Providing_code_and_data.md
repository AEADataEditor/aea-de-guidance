# Providing Code and Data to the Data Editor

This page describes how to provide materials to the Data Editor when requested to do so by your Journal Editor. 

Until further notice, **final code** should be provided as per Instructions at the official [AEA Data Availability Policy page](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-availability-policy) and/or as per instructions from the AEA Editorial office.

## Materials to provide
- Draft manuscript
- Any relevant appendices
- README
- Code for all tables, figures, and in-text numbers of the manuscript
- Data for the above, if available
- Information on how to access the data, if not

## If you use online drives
If you use Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc., then you can share a folder with the AEA Data Editor. We may request you to share it with the assigned replicator as well. Please contact the Data Editor for the address(es) to share with. 

## If you have a data and/or code repository set up
If you use Github, Bitbucket, openICPSR, Dataverse, etc. for your code and/or data, then you can share the location of these with the AEA Data Editor. If the repository is private (not public), then most repositories have a method to share the repository privately, please consult with the archive and/or the Data Editor for details.

## If none of the above apply
If you use none of the methods above, or you prefer to provide us with a physical copy, then provision by ZIP file is fine, assuming the files are not too large. Please contact us if you encounter problems.

## If your data is not public-use
- We would still like to obtain a copy of your code (see above)
- You should include in the article or README the access procedures so that a new user can attempt to access the data
- You should provide in that description, or privately to the Data Editor, an estimate of how long such procedures may take
- You should provide privately to the Data Editor whether you are able to **add a third-party** to your research protocol
  - This can be a member of your research institution who was not involved in the research.
  - This can be a member of the AEA Data Editor's team, 
- We will provide your Editor with an assessment of whether our team or a trusted third party can conduct a reproducibility exercise in a timely fashion.
