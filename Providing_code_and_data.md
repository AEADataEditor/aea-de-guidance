# Providing Code and Data to the Data Editor

This page describes how to provide materials to the Data Editor when requested to do so by your Journal Editor. 

> Until further notice, **final code** should be provided as per Instructions at the official [AEA Data Availability Policy page](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-availability-policy) and/or as per instructions from the AEA Editorial office.

## Materials to provide
- [ ] Draft manuscript
- [ ] Any relevant appendices
- [ ] README
- [ ] Code for all tables, figures, and in-text numbers of the manuscript
- [ ] Data for the above, if available
- [ ] Information on how to access the data, if not

## Default provision through the AEA Code and Data Repository at ICPSR

Please follow [instructions provided at the Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea/deposit-instructions). The Repository allows researchers to share data prior to publication, but will also be the final publication location, reducing the need to move data around. [Detailed guidance on how to deposit data at the AEA Data and Code Repository](data-deposit-aea-guidance.md) is available. 


## If you use online drives
If you use Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc., then you should upload from there to the [AEA Code and Data Repository at ICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea/deposit-instructions). 

## If you have a data and/or code repository set up
If you use development (Github, Bitbucket, etc.) or permanent (openICPSR, Dataverse, etc.) repositories for your code and/or data, then you can share the location of these with the AEA Data Editor. If the repository is private (not public), then most repositories have a method to share the repository privately, please consult with the archive and/or the Data Editor for details. 

Note that if the data and code are in a development repository (Github and the like), the data and code still need to be deposited to a permanent location prior to publication. 

## If none of the above apply
If you use none of the methods above, or you prefer to provide us with a physical copy, then provision by ZIP file is fine, assuming the files are not too large. Please contact us if you encounter problems.

## If your data is not public-use
- We would still like to obtain a copy of your code (see above)
- You should include enough information about the data (codebook, variable list, variable descriptions, values, summary statistics) that a person without access to the data could form an opinion about the data
- You should include in the article or README the access procedures so that a new user can attempt to access the data
- You should provide in that description, or privately to the Data Editor, an estimate of how long such procedures may take
- You should provide privately to the Data Editor whether you are able to **add a third-party** to your research protocol
  - This can be a member of your research institution who was not involved in the research.
  - This can be a member of the AEA Data Editor's team.

We will provide your Editor with an assessment of whether our team or a trusted third party can conduct a reproducibility exercise in a timely fashion.
