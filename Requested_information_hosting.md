## Suggested Information for Data and Code Hosting

### Trusted Repositories
Journals and institutions have assessed a number of trusted repositories:
- [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) has a certification process
- [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) lists research data repositories
- [Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories), [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines#hosting), and [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability) (and soon the AEA) have lists of trusted repositories.
- These generally include at least the following:
  -  [Dryad Digital Repository](http://datadryad.org/)
  -  [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
  -  [Harvard Dataverse Network](http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/)
  -  [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/) and [OPENICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/)
  -  [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/)
  -  [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/)
- Many universities have formal document repositories that may be able to assume such a role; talk to your (data) librarian
- Restricted-access and secure data centers also assume the role of trusted repositories:
  - e.g. [Federal Statistical Research Data Centers](https://www.census.gov/fsrdc) for a variety of statistical microdata in the US
  - e.g. [Cornell Restricted Access Data Center (CRADC)](https://ciser.cornell.edu/data/secure-data-services/cradc/) for an example of a campus-wide secure data center and archive
  - e.g. [Centre d’accès sécurisé aux données (CASD)](https://www.casd.eu/) for an example of a European equivalent of the FSRDCs
  - e.g. [Health Care Cost Institute](https://www.healthcostinstitute.org/about-hcci/) for an example of an industry-based data center for research
- Note that some data archives can also handle restrictions on data dissemination for various reasons
  - [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/confidentiality/) can handle certain types of confidential data
  - [Zenodo](http://about.zenodo.org/policies/) can handle license-based restricted access
- We note that acceptable access restrictions are limited to concerns of confidentiality or third-party licensing. We do not accept (permanent) access restrictions where
  - the author is the sole arbitrar of access
  - sharing is not allowed because of personal interests (future publications, patents, etc.)

### NOT ACCEPTABLE
A variety of (unfortunately) commonly used web-accessible locations are not acceptable as data repositories for the purpose of an article's supplementary materials:
- [Github](https://github.com), because a project's owner can delete a git repository at any time (but see [this page](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) on how to leverage Zenodo to enable proper archiving of code and software);
- Google pages, university and personal faculty web pages - they can all be deleted by the owner or by the employer (the university) without regards to archival characteristics of its contents (but talk to your university library - they may have a way to facilitate archiving of web pages - and investigate the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/) for a similar purpose);
- Dropbox, Box.com, and similar cloud-based data and file sharing services - again, they can all be deleted at short notice, or when payment stops

## Challenges in Hosting of Data and Code at Restricted-Access Data Centers
Users of restricted-access data centers (RADC, such as [FSRDCs](https://www.census.gov/fsrdc),  [CASD](https://www.casd.eu/), etc.) face certain challenges in the handling of data and code as described in this document:

- researchers (end-users) may not be able to provide DOI or similar persistent identifiers for some data
- researchers may not be able to discern the presrvation policy for certain data sets
- researchers may not be able to remove all code from the center, or such removal is subject to restrictions
- data citation guidance may be lacking, or may not be obvious (see [Data Citation Guidance](Data_citation_guidance.md) for general guidance)

### A few guidelines

- Request as much code as the RADC  will allow the researcher to remove. Subsequently handle it equivalently to the [general code guidance](Requested_information_code.md), but make special note (placeholders, explanatory text) of any redacted information.
- In addition, some RADC may provide the ability to deposit code internally and confidentially. Use such interal repositories, and make a note of their location in the publicly deposited code or in supplementary documents.

### Self-generated repositories
If a RADC has at least an archival or backup policy of sufficient length (e.g., 10 or more years), but does not offer a formal repository, then the following procedure allows users
- As before, request as much code as is feasible, and deposit it in a public repository (e.g., openICPSR, Dataverse, Zenodo). **Don't publish it yet.**
- If possible at such repositories, pre-register a `DOI`
  - At Zenodo: click the appropriation request button, and a `DOI` will be assigned, e.g., _10.5281/zenodo.`NNNNN`_.
  - At openICPSR: projects are called `openicpsr-NNNNN`. The `DOI` is derived from the project number as _10.3886/E`NNNNN`V1_.
- In the RADC, create a two-level directory with the name of the `DOI`.
- Move both data (following guidelines outlined [here](Requested_information_code.md)) and **all** code (not just the confidential part) to subdirectories. The resulting directory structure will look something like this:
```
/some/path/project/10.5281/zenodo.NNNNN/:
      data/original/rawdata.dta
      data/derived/analysis.dta
      programs/01_cleaning.do
      programs/02_analysis.do
```
- Confirm with the RADC's administrative staff how long project files are kept as archives or in backup (often 5-10 years)
- Add a statement to the public README.md (and to article materials).

The data used for this paper were prepared in the U.S. Census Bureau’s
secure computing facilities under an authorized project using the Research
Data Center network. The exact analysis files have been fully archived
so that the programming sequence submitted in compliance with the [JOURNAL]’s
editorial policy can be run in its entirety, except for the component that
extracts the analysis sample from the underlying confidential databases.

I grant any researchers with appropriate Census-approved project permission
to use my exact research files provided that those files were among the
ones that they requested when the approval was obtained (a Census Bureau
requirement). These files can be found by searching for the DOI of [this archive/ this article] amongst backups/archives made in [month of archive].

I authorize the editorial staff of the [JOURNAL] to provide my statement
of cooperation to any researcher who requests it, as well as to the U.S.
Census Bureau or any agency cooperating with the Census Bureau in supervising
research that uses the restricted-access data that I have used.
