# Commercial Data
Many economics papers use data from individual private companies, as well as from commercial data aggregators. Generally, these data cannot be redistributed by the author of a paper. Usage rights must be acquired from the original provider. This is not dissimilar from restricted data from statistical agencies, though there is significantly more variation in access procedures and cost.

This page uses a few examples, and suggested descriptions of data access for these examples. If you have an example to suggest for this page, send an email to dataeditor@aeaweb.org or [create a pull request](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-de-guidance/pulls/new).

## Compustat(R)
