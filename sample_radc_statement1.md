The data used for this paper were prepared in the U.S. Census Bureau’s
secure computing facilities under an authorized project using the Research
Data Center network. The exact analysis files have been fully archived
so that the programming sequence submitted in compliance with the [JOURNAL]’s
editorial policy can be run in its entirety, except for the component that
extracts the analysis sample from the underlying confidential databases.

I grant any researchers with appropriate Census-approved project permission
to use my exact research files provided that those files were among the
ones that they requested when the approval was obtained (a Census Bureau
requirement). These files can be found by searching for the DOI of [this archive/ this article] amongst backups/archives made in [month of archive].

I authorize the editorial staff of the [JOURNAL] to provide my statement
of cooperation to any researcher who requests it, as well as to the U.S.
Census Bureau or any agency cooperating with the Census Bureau in supervising
research that uses the restricted-access data that I have used.
