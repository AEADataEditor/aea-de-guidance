# Sample Language that may be used in the REPLICATON report

The following fragments may be used when reporting back on success or failure of a reproduction attempt. They usually identify lack of some key component. They should be added to the completed [REPLICATION.md](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md)

> The article uses restricted-access data. Access to the data cannot be obtained in a timely fashion, a reproduction is not attempted. The report contains information on data description, and identifies whether all tables and figures can be identified in the code. 

> [SUGGESTED] A template README file can be found on the [AEA Data Editor Github site](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/template-README.html).

> [REQUIRED] Please ensure that a ASCII (txt), Markdown (md), or PDF version of the README are available in the data and code deposit.

> [REQUIRED] Please add data citations to the article. Guidance on how to cite data is provided in the [AEA Sample References](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references).

> [REQUIRED] Please provide a clear description of access modality and location for this dataset.

> [SUGGESTED] The default AEA bibtex style file does not display URLs in the bibliography. A workaround might be to use the slightly modified [draft style file](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-de-guidance/blob/master/citations/aea-mod.bst) or the `econ` style file referenced [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/random-author-order). 

> [REQUIRED] Please provide complete code, including for appendix tables and figures, and identify source for inline numbers.

> [REQUIRED] Please add a link to the full codebook to the README.

(used when dataset is primary, and raw data is not provided with the replication archive)

> [SUGGESTED] Please link to codebooks for these two datasets in the README.

(used when datasets are of secondary importance)

> [REQUIRED] Please add a setup program that installs all packages as noted above. 

> [REQUIRED] Please provide debugged code, addressing the issues identified in this report.


> [SUGGESTED] Please adjust your tables to account for the noted numerical discrepancies. Use of packages that automatically write out tables is strongly encouraged.

> [SUGGESTED] We strongly suggest using  data load statement instead of manual instructions to load data

## Relative to the openICPSR deposit

> [REQUIRED] Several required metadata elements are missing from the openICPSR deposit. Please consult our [additional deposit guidance](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html)

> [SUGGESTED] Several suggested metadata elements are missing from the openICPSR deposit. Please consult our [additional deposit guidance](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html)

> [REQUIRED]  ZIP files should be uploaded via "Import from ZIP" instead of "Upload Files" (there should be no ZIP files visible, except in certain circumstances, like when there are too many files). Please delete the ZIP files, and re-upload using the "Import from ZIP" function.

> [REQUIRED]  Please delete the `__MACOS` directory
    
> [REQUIRED]   Please delete empty directories
    
> [REQUIRED]   Please delete any redundant (obsolete) files
