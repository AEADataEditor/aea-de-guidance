                policies for leading journals in economics on citations. As has
                previously been shown for other social sciences, there is an
                indication that the introduction of a replication policy
                increases the number of citations for a journal, presumably
                because readers use the data for their own investigation,
                possibly also because of a reliability effect. We see our
                results as an incentive for journals to introduce and enforce
                replication policies. Lamentably, only a minority of journals
                so far enforce their policies in a way that ensures
                replicability of most of the empirical work. With several
                examples we show how replication becomes difficult if policies
                are not enforced, and we suggest a pool of replicability
                editors as a solution: Since it would be too much to expect
                from journals to have experts for every single topic and
                software package, a joint effort of journals for such a pool of
                experts could help to ensure each empirical study is published
                with data, code, and instructions how to use them together such
                that all published results can easily be replicated. Reviewers
                can join the effort for replicability by following the
                principles of the Agenda for Open Research and refuse to
                comprehensively review empirical work that does not guarantee
                fully replicable empirical results. Further study is needed to
                investigate the citation impact on single articles, and we
                suggest a design for such research.",

  abstract   = "This paper discusses recent trends in the use of replications
                in economics. We identify a number of sources of progress,
                including the results of recent replication studies that have
                attempted to identify replication rates within the discipline.
                These studies generally find that replication rates are
                relatively low, though they may be higher for laboratory
                experiments in economics. We also identify two web-based
                resources for replications, the Replication in Economics wiki
                and The Replication Network. We then consider obstacles to
                undertaking replication studies in economics. Two obstacles are
                the lack of publishing outlets and difficulties in obtaining
                data and code for published studies. We identify journals that
                publish replication studies and that ``regularly'' include data
                and code as supplementary files for their published research.
                Finally, we highlight replication initiatives in psychology and
                political science, behind which economics appears to lag.
                Whether this is because the problems that beset those
                disciplines are less severe in economics, or because economics
                is more resistant to replications, is arguable.",
