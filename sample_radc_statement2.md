To reproduce the tables and figures in the paper:

1. All the results in the paper use confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. To gain
access to the Census microdata, follow the directions here on how to write a proposal for access
to the data via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center:
https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/howtoapply.html.

2. You must request the following datasets in your proposal:
   a. Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), 2002 and 2007
   b. Foreign Trade Database – Import (IMP), 2002 and 2007
   c. Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), including the Computer Network Use
      Supplement (CNUS), 1999
   [...]
   z. Annual Survey of Magical Inputs (ASMI), 2002 and 2007

3. Reference “Technology and Production Fragmentation: Domestic versus Foreign
   Sourcing” by Teresa Fort, project number br1179 in the proposal. This will give you access to
   the programs and input datasets required to reproduce the results. Requesting a search of archives
   with the articles DOI ("10.1093/restud/rdw057") should yield the same results. 
   NOTE: Project-related files are available for 10 years as of 2015. 
   
Note that all the programs required to reproduce the results are also available on the REStud website.
