## Guidance on Data Citation

Official guidance of the AEA is available at https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references. The guidance provided here is in addition, and may be the basis for future official guidance.

### Data Citations
Properly referencing data goes beyond just reproducibility - it is also proper scientific writing style. In the same way that we use bibliographic references to "printed" resources, we should also be using such references for data resources, to give and receive credit where credit is due. Not referencing an article or book is at best an oversight, and at worst plagiarism - and the same should apply to data objects. Numerous guides and tutorials exist:

- DataONE [Tutorial on Data Citation](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/L09_DataCitation.pptx) and [generic guidance](https://www.dataone.org/citing-dataone)
- [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/curation/citations.jsp)
-  Force11's [Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principals](https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk)
- the AEA's own [Sample References](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references)


### What to cite

In a nutshell, every dataset is to be cited. This is true for the main article as well as online appendices. In the past, use of data or code has been acknowledged in footnotes, and only rarely through bibliographic references. However,  if the dataset is used, it should appear in the bibliography. The same is true for code reused from previous papers, or provided by authors.

### How to cite

The AEA uses the Chicago style for citations and bibliographies [1](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references). However, the [Chicago Style Manual](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html)  does not provide examples for data citations, and neither does the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) used by applications like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley Desktop](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/).


[DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/citing-dataone) suggests content and style that resemble the generic working paper or article citation style (adapted to Chicago style):

> Westbrook JW, Kitajima K, Burleigh JG, Kress WJ, Erickson DL,
>    Wright SJ (2011) *Data from: What makes a leaf tough? Patterns of
>    correlated evolution between leaf toughness traits and demographic
>    rates among 197 shade-tolerant woody species in a neotropical forest.*
>    Dryad Digital Repository. http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8525

[ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/curation/citations.jsp) notes  that a citation should include the following items:
-   Title
-   Author
-   Date
-   Version
-   Persistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)

and provides a few examples, with some additional modifiers:

>    Esther Duflo; Rohini Pande, 2006, ``Dams, Poverty, Public Goods and
>    Malaria Incidence in India'', http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/IOJHHXOOLZ
>    UNF:5:obNHHq1gtV400a4T+Xrp9g== *Murray Research Archive* [Distributor]
>    V2 [Version]

Finally, the [AEA style guide](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references)  suggests

>    Leiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945--1968.''
>    Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI.
>    ICPSR05404-v1. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404 (accessed February 8, 2011).

This may be adjusted. An alternate citation may be

>    Leiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945--1968.''
>    Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI.
>    ICPSR05404-v1. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05404.

### Tools
No tool is perfect, but you will likely find the one that works for your particular workflow. 
Some examples for specific software:
- [BibTeX](citations/guidance_data_citations.pdf)
- [BibLaTeX](citations/guidance_data_citations_biblatex.pdf)
- Zotero will have native dataset functionality starting in version 5.1, for now, some guidance for entering it can be found in [forums](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/63616/new-citation-type-research-data-dataset). Note that support in the citation styles is also still lacking.
- [Mendeley Desktop](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/).
- [Citation Machine](http://www.citationmachine.net/chicago-17-author-date/cite-a-digital/manual) - choose `Source type`=`Digital file` and put the URL and access date into the `Annotation` field.
