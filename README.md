# Unofficial guidance on various topics by the AEA Data Editor


These  web pages provide unofficial and developing guidance on the implementation of the American Economic Association (AEA)'s Data and Code Availability Policy. We also provide links to [generic guidance](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/) being developed by a loose collective ("guild") of data editors and people in a similar role at various social science journals.

## Order in which AEA authors should read these resources

> 1. Start with the **[official Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code)**
> 2. Follow the **[step-by-step guidance](step-by-step.md)** to walk you through preparing and uploading your replication packages, and what to expect afterwards.

## Additional guidance 

In addition to the detailed [step-by-step guidance](step-by-step.md), the following sites contain useful information:

> 1. Look for general guidance at the **[Social Science Data Editors pages](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/)**
> 2. Read the **[AEA's FAQ](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code/faq)**
> 3. Have a look at the **[draft FAQ on this site](FAQ.md)** for thorny issues

Comments are welcome, please file them  as [issues](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-de-guidance/issues) in our Github repo.

## Guidance on creating replicable data and program archives

How should researchers create replicable data and program archives? How should such archives be structured, how documented, and where should they be located?

---

> **[README template](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/template-README.html)** 

> **[Preparing for a data and code deposit](preparing-for-data-deposit.md)**

---

- **Common guidance**: Several economics and other social science data editors are collaborating this. See [https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/) for more detailed guidance. Your replication package should be able to be submitted to any journal.
- A **[README template](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/template-README.html)** recommended by multiple data editors in economics can be used as a starting point for a data and code archive's master README, describing where the data comes from, what resources are necessary to reproduce the paper's results, and how to run the code.
- **Licensing**: Issues about licensing are complex, we suggest the [Social Science Data Editor's discussion of licensing](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Licensing_guidance.html). The [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea) defaults to a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC-BY) license; however, we suggest that authors choose a [hybrid license](licenses/LICENSE-template.txt) when their repository contains data, code and software, as the CC-BY license is [not recommended for software](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_software.3F).

## Guidance on data citations

Data citation is critical for documenting data provenance, and the **AEA requires data citations**. But data citations can also be hard. 

- General guidance can be found on the [Social Science Data Editor's page on the topic](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Data_citation_guidance.html)
  - Some particularly thorny issues can be found [on this website](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html.

## Guidance on depositing in the AEA Data and Code Repository

---

> **[Detailed guidance](data-deposit-aea.md)**

---

The AEA migrated to a new data and code repository in July 2019. See

- the [official Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code), 
- the associated [FAQ](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code/faq),  
- [detailed additional guidance on these pages](data-deposit-aea.md), and the [draft FAQ on this site](FAQ.md)

## Guidance on testing replicability of code

---

> **[Our replication template report](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md)**

--- 

The code and data that have been archived should be reproducible and replicable. How do we test that?

- Generic guidance is provided at the [Social Science Data Editors' Guidance](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/) website. 
- At the AEA,
  - we use **[this template](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md)** to guide our replicators. 
    - [Example 1](sample-report.md)
  - We assess 
    - software availability
    - data availability
    - code availability and clarity
    - needed computational resources
    - time needed to acquire or use all of the above, and conduct the reproducibility check
  - When some of the conditions are not met with our own resources, we may ask others to conduct a reproducibility exercise for us. 
    - Our [PROTOCOL](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-third-party) describes how we might request reports.
    - [Sample report 1](sample-report-3rd-1.md)
    - We may ask others to do so because
      - They are experts
      - They have access to the software
      - They have access to the data
      - They have access to computational resources needed
  - **No reproducibility check is discarded out of hand**


## Frequently Asked Questions

- Start by consulting the [FAQ](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code/faq) on the AEA Website. This generally apply specifically to procedures at the AEA journals.
- AEA-specific updates and additions will first appear in [draft FAQ on this site](FAQ.md)
- More general questions will have answers at the  [Social Science Data Editors FAQ](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/FAQ.html)
