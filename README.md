# Unofficial guidance on various topics by the AEA Data Editor

These web pages provide unofficial and developing guidance on the implementation of the American Economic Association (AEA)'s Data and Code Availability Policy. We also provide links to [generic guidance](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/) being developed by a loose collective ("guild") of data editors and people in a similar role at various social science journals.

Comments are welcome, please file them  as [issues](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/aea-de-guidance/issues) in our Github repo.

## Guidance on creating replicable data and program archives

How should researchers create replicable data and program archives? How should such archives be structured, how documented, and where should they be located?

- Several economics and other social science data editors are collaborating on common guidance. See [https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/) for more detailed guidance.
- The AEA migrated to a new data and code repository in July 2019. We provide [specific guidance on how to deposit data at the AEA Data and Code Repository](data-deposit-aea-guidance.md). 

## Guidance on testing replicability of code
The code and data that have been archived should be reproducible and replicable. How do we test that? 

- Generic guidance is provided at the [Social Science Data Editors' Guidance](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/) website. 
- At the AEA, 
  - we use [this template](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md) to guide our replicators. 
    - [Example 1](sample-report.md)
  - When we cannot access some part of the data and/or code ourselves, we may ask others to conduct a reproducibility exercise for us. 
    - Our [PROTOCOL](protocol-3rd-party-replication.md) is outlined here.
    - [Sample report 1](sample-report-3rd-1.md)
