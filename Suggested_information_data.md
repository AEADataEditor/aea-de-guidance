## Suggested Information for Data
### Data description
-  Please describe all data, including input data.
  - At a minimum, all variables that are used in the paper should be well-described (variable/column labels, value labels, summary statistics) through a codebook.
  - If confidentiality protection is a concern, talk to your data provider. You may be able to apply simple count and fraction rounding rules (see [code in this Github repository](https://github.com/simsong/drb_rounder)), or remove some summary statistics (e.g., max/min or specific quantiles).
-  Where multiple versions of the data exist, describe the version of the data used by the author.
  -  If possible, provide a Digital Object Identifier.
-  This information can be generated by the paper author, or provided by pointing to a URL of the data provider (for instance an online codebook).

### Practical guidance: Data description

It doesn't need to be complicated, but should be complete.

#### Stata

In Stata,the native 'codebook' command can generate such information:
```
// Stata
use my_input_data
describe
codebook
```
See [code/01_codebook_fancy.md](code/01_codebook_fancy.md) for a fancier example, and [code/02_codebook_plaintext.md](code/02_codebook_plaintext.md) for the code and output from the simpler example.

#### R

In R, the [dataMaid](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataMaid/index.html) [[1](http://sandsynligvis.dk/2017/08/21/datamaid-your-personal-assistant-for-cleaning-up-the-data-cleaning-process/)], [[2](http://sandsynligvis.dk/articles/18/codebook.html)] can accomplish a similar task:
```{r}
# use the    dataMaid   package
library(dataMaid)
makeCodebook(my_input_data)
```

However, if you have the ability to do a more robust data description, you should. See a [self-citing example](https://www2.ncrn.cornell.edu/ced2ar-web/codebooks/synlbd/v/v2).

### Data access description
The description of data access should provide enough information so that an uninformed user could theoretically access the data.
- This can be as simple as a download URL.
- It might be a pointer to a directory in the replication archive.
- This might also be the URL for a description of the application procedure (e.g. NCHS, https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/leftbrch/userestricdt.htm , or PSID https://simba.isr.umich.edu/restricted/ProcessReq.aspx), and an estimate of the monetary and time cost of the application process.
- Provide the date when the data access description was valid. For long-running projects, this may be the information when YOU accessed the data, or it may be the access information for somebody who wants to access the data TODAY.
- Provide information on the **access conditions**:
  - Does a downloader need to agree to simple terms of use? (Example: IPUMS-USA https://usa.ipums.org/usa/cite.shtml)
  - Does the researcher need to provide information (project proposal, computer security plan, etc.)? (Example: PSID https://simba.isr.umich.edu/U/CondUse.aspx)
  - Is there perhaps a residency or citizen requirement?

### Data persistence
-  Data should remain available for a sufficiently long time.
-  By depositing in the **AEA Data and Code Repository**, the data (and code) will remain available indefinitely.
-  This is also true if the data is in various other repositories (list of acceptable repositories forthcoming).
-  This may also be true if the data cannot be shared (restricted access data). Ask your data provider what the archival duration or retention period is.
-  A good minimum benchmark is 10 years, but this may not always be feasible with data the author does not control.

### What is a data provider
A "data provider" in this sense can be a public repository where the data can be found ([ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)), a website that provided the data ([IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/)), a statistical agency or private company that granted access to the data ([U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/fsrdc), Twitter, Acme Inc.).
The author may also be the data provider, for instance, because the author conducted the survey used in the article.
