# Providing Code and Data to the Data Editor

This page describes how to provide code to the Data Editor when requested to do so by your Editor. 

Until further notice, **final code** should be provided as per Instructions at the official [AEA Data Availability Policy page](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-availability-policy) and/or as per instructions from the AEA Editorial office.

## If you use online drives
If you use Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc., then you can share a folder with the AEA Data Editor. We may request you to share it with the assigned replicator as well. Please contact the Data Editor for the address(es) to share with. 

## If you have a data and/or code repository set up
If you use Github, Bitbucket, openICPSR, Dataverse, etc. for your code and/or data, then you can share the location of these with the AEA Data Editor. If the repository is private (not public), then most repositories have a method to share the repository privately, please consult with the archive and/or the Data Editor for details.

## If none of the above apply
If you use none of the methods above, or you prefer to provide us with a physical copy, then provision by ZIP file is fine, assuming the files are not too large. Please contact us if you encounter problems.
