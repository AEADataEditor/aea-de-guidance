## Suggested Information for Data and Code Hosting

### Trusted Repositories
Journals and institutions have assessed a number of trusted repositories:
- [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) has a certification process
- [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) lists research data repositories
- [Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories), [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines#hosting), and [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability) (and soon the AEA) have lists of trusted repositories.
- These generally include at least the following:
  -  [Dryad Digital Repository](http://datadryad.org/)
  -  [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
  -  [Harvard Dataverse Network](http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/)
  -  [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
  -  [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/)
  -  [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/)
- Many universities have formal document repositories that may be able to assume such a role; talk to your (data) librarian
- Restricted-access and secure data centers also assume the role of trusted repositories:
  - e.g. [Federal Statistical Research Data Centers](https://www.census.gov/fsrdc) for a variety of statistical microdata in the US
  - e.g. [Cornell Restricted Access Data Center (CRADC)](https://ciser.cornell.edu/data/secure-data-services/cradc/) for an example of a campus-wide secure data center and archive
  - e.g. [Centre d’accès sécurisé aux données (CASD)](https://www.casd.eu/) for an example of a European equivalent of the FSRDCs
  - e.g. [Health Care Cost Institute](https://www.healthcostinstitute.org/about-hcci/) for an example of an industry-based data center for research

### NOT ACCEPTABLE
A variety of (unfortunately) commonly used web-accessible locations are not acceptable as data repositories for the purpose of an article's supplementary materials:
- [Github](https://github.com), because a project's owner can delete a git repository at any time (but see [this page](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) on how to leverage Zenodo to enable proper archiving of code and software);
- Google pages, university and personal faculty web pages - they can all be deleted by the owner or by the employer (the university) without regards to archival characteristics of its contents (but talk to your university library - they may have a way to facilitate archiving of web pages - and investigate the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/) for a similar purpose);
- Dropbox, Box.com, and similar cloud-based data and file sharing services - again, they can all be deleted at short notice, or when payment stops
